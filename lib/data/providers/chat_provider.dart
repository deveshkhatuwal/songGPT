The whispers of the wind, they call your name, In the hues of blue, nothing feels the same.\n(Chorus) Oh, shades of blue, where dreams collide, In the ocean of your heart, I want to reside. Every tear and every laugh, a beautiful hue, In this world of colors, Iâ€™m lost in you.\n(Verse 2) Underneath the stars, we dance so free, A symphony of silence, just you and me. The night wraps around, like a velvet shawl, In the depths of blue, I surrender it all.\n(Chorus) Oh, shades of blue, where dreams collide, In the ocean of your heart, I want to reside. Every tear and every laugh, a beautiful hue, In this world of colors, Iâ€™m lost in you.\n(Bridge) So let the colors swirl, let the moments flow, In the spectrum of our love, weâ€™ll always glow. The world may fade, but we will stay true, Forever in the shades, forever in blue.\n"
